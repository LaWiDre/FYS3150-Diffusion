# FYS3150-Diffusion
A folder containing all created material by me and Gabriel Sigurd Cabrera for the course FYS3150 during the last project of the course. We modelled diffusion using the julia language, and implemented the explicit Forward Euler, implicit Backward Euler and implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme.
